# CAMPAYN

## Problem
Influencer marketing is broken. Companies manually hunt for influencers, negotiate rates, and pray for authentic content. Traditional platforms take massive cuts (20-30%) while offering zero transparency on performance metrics or reward distribution.

## Solution
CAMPAYN is a decentralized influencer marketing platform where:

- Companies deposit FLOW tokens for campaign rewards
- Influencers submit YouTube videos and compete based on performance
- Top 3 performers automatically receive rewards (50%, 30%, 20%)
- Smart contracts ensure transparent, automated reward distribution
- Zero middleman fees - direct creator-to-brand relationships
